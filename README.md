# Wells
A lightweight diagnostics report submission system

## Integration

Swift Package Manager:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ChimeHQ/Wells.git")
]
```

### Namesake

Wells is also about reporting, so it seemed logical to name it after a [notable journalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_B._Wells).
